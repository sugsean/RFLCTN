Right, so we've officially run out of things to worry about, haven't we? Just when I thought the beauty industry had exhausted every possible body part to obsess over, they've found a new frontier: the youthful neck. Apparently, people barely out of their teens are now identifying their neck as a ‘problem area’. My neck at 20 was worried about holding up my head after a proper night out in Shoreditch, not fine lines. But here we are, facing down 'neck anxiety' before we've even properly experienced adulting.

It’s not enough to battle forehead wrinkles and crow’s feet; now we’re scrutinising our platysmal bands before we’ve even had a decent Sunday roast. Blame it on the endless scroll, the relentless Zoom calls, the high-def selfies that somehow manage to pick out every perceived flaw. Londoners, myself included, are always glancing at reflections in shop windows or the Tube, but now it’s not just the outfit – it’s the angle of the jawline, the smoothness of the throat. It’s a proper panic, it seems, as younger generations join the queue for preventative treatments.

And naturally, where there’s a perceived problem, there’s an entire industry ready to ‘solve’ it – with a £70 neck serum, naturally. Before you can say "preventative Botox," brands are rushing out ‘targeted firming elixirs’ and ‘youth-preserving décolletage treatments’. All promising to keep your neck looking like it did when you were, well, *actually young*. Because who needs to actually enjoy their youth when you can spend it meticulously applying cream to an area that probably doesn't need it? It's the ultimate pre-emptive strike against the inevitable.

Look, I take fashion and beauty seriously as cultural forces; they reflect our desires, our anxieties, our collective dreams. But this ‘neck anxiety’ thing feels like peak absurdity. It’s another symptom of a culture that demands perfection at every age, pushing us to fear natural ageing even before it begins. It's a marketing ploy wrapped in a manufactured insecurity, designed to make us part with our hard-earned cash for a problem we didn't even know we had five minutes ago.

Maybe we should all just... wear scarves? Or, you know, just accept that necks exist and will eventually age. Proper radical thought, that. Are we really so terrified of looking like we’ve lived a bit that we’re pre-emptively treating our necks before we’ve even properly lived? Fair play to the brands for spotting the gap, but I think I’ll save my pennies for a decent meal deal and worry about my neck when it actually starts looking like it's been around the block.
