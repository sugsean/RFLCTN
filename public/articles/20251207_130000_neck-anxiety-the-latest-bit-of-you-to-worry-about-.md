Right, so I thought I’d heard it all. Cellulite on your elbows? Fine lines behind your knees? But now, apparently, we’re all supposed to be panicking about our *necks*. And not even us old gits, but the youth. The actual kids. According to Business of Fashion, "neck anxiety" is getting younger, and beauty brands are bare rushing to get in on the action before Gen Z decides to go under the knife.

Honestly, can we just have a moment? It feels like every other week there’s a new "problem area" invented, purely so some lab in France can whip up a £200 cream to fix it. This isn't about genuine concern for skin health; it’s about capitalising on an ever-present, insidious anxiety. The industry's always been good at making us feel inadequate, but targeting the neck on someone who probably still gets ID'd for a meal deal? That’s next level.

I spend enough time on the Northern Line wondering if my trousers are too wide or if my trainers are still cool. The last thing I'm clocking is the *contour* of someone's neck. Are people really sat in Shoreditch coffee shops, scrolling TikTok, and suddenly thinking, "Blimey, my neck's looking a bit saggy, innit?" It feels like another manufactured insecurity designed to keep the beauty conveyor belt churning out products we absolutely do not need.

Look, here’s the thing: fashion and beauty can be brilliant. They can be art, expression, identity. But they can also be a proper piss-take, pushing us to worry about things we’d never even considered before. We're talking about preventative neck procedures for people who probably haven't even realised they need to start saving for a deposit. The whole idea feels like a satirical sketch, except it's actually happening.

What’s next? Elbow wrinkles? Ankle age spots? We’re already constantly bombarded with images of 'perfection' that are utterly unattainable without a team of stylists and a filter. Fair play to brands for innovating, but when the innovation is creating a problem that didn't exist for people barely out of their teens, you’ve got to question the actual ethics of it all. Maybe we should focus on looking up from our phones (hello, 'tech neck' – *that* one's real, mind) and enjoy our lives, rather than meticulously inspecting every bit of ourselves for potential flaws.
