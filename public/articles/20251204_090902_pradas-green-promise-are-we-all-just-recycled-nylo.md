title: 'Prada’s Green Promise: Are We All Just Recycled Nylon Sceptics Now?'
---

Right, so Prada, the undisputed king of sleek black nylon and equally sleek marketing, has unveiled a new collection that's apparently all about sustainability and ethical production. Vogue Business is buzzing about it, and fair play, it sounds like a step in the right direction. But after years of hearing every luxury brand on the planet suddenly declare themselves "eco-conscious," one does start to feel a bit like a cynical old git, doesn't one?

Look, here's the thing: I genuinely appreciate the effort. When a powerhouse like Prada throws its weight behind sustainable materials, it sends a proper ripple through the industry. We're talking recycled nylon (Re-Nylon, presumably), organic cotton, all the usual suspects that make you feel a tiny bit less guilty about dropping a grand on a handbag. The intention is there, the materials are there. But can we really talk about "ethical production" when a single accessory costs more than a month's rent in, say, Peckham?

It’s the same conundrum we’ve seen played out time and again. The fashion industry, bless its cotton socks, loves to pat itself on the back for sustainability initiatives, all while churning out multiple collections a year and encouraging relentless consumption. It's like serving up a perfectly crafted vegan meal on a plate made from endangered species. The sentiment's great, but the inherent contradiction is doing a proper jig in the background.

Saw a bloke on the Central Line this morning, clutching a vintage Prada bag. Looked fantastic, obviously. But it made me wonder: is "sustainable luxury" just another way for brands to justify exorbitant prices to a generation that actually cares about the planet? Or is it a genuine, albeit slow and imperfect, shift towards a better future? My gut says it’s probably a bit of both, a cheeky nod to doing good while still doing very good business.

Mind you, credit where it's due. Any move towards better practices from a brand as influential as Prada is a good thing, even if it feels like dipping a toe in the ocean rather than diving headfirst. But until we start seeing these sustainable efforts trickle down to genuinely accessible price points, and a serious re-evaluation of the sheer volume of clothes produced, I'll be over here, sipping my lukewarm builder's tea and raising a sceptical eyebrow.
