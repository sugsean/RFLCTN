title: 'The Neck''s Got Next: Why Your Throat Is Suddenly Your Biggest Worry'

Right, so just when you thought you’d mastered the art of ignoring the existential dread of climate change, the cost of living crisis, and whether you've actually locked your front door, a new anxiety has entered the chat. Your neck, apparently. Yes, that bit between your chin and your shoulders, the one that holds your head up, is now a 'problem area' for the younger generation. Proper mad, innit?

According to the Business of Fashion, 'neck anxiety' is getting younger, with beauty brands tripping over themselves to offer creams and treatments before Gen Z decides to go under the knife. Because nothing says 'youthful glow' quite like a £300 serum for a body part you barely thought about until five minutes ago. It’s a classic move: identify a new insecurity, then sell the 'cure' at a markup that would make a Shoreditch flat owner blush.

It’s not enough to worry about frown lines, crow’s feet, or the general havoc wrought by too many late nights and questionable meal deals. Now we’re meant to be scrutinising our necks for 'tech neck' lines (thanks, TikTok scrolling) or the dreaded 'turkey wattle' (cheers, genetics). It begs the question: is there any part of the human form left untouched by the relentless gaze of perceived imperfection? Are we just going to slowly work our way down, limb by limb, until we’re all stressing about our perfectly normal elbows?

The beauty industry, ever the opportunist, is already on it. Forget your simple moisturiser; now we’ve got targeted neck creams, serums specifically for the décolletage, and even devices that promise to zap away those lines. It’s all a bit of a piss-take, really. While I’m all for looking after your skin, the idea that a cream can prevent or reverse the effects of gravity and time to the point where surgery is no longer considered is… optimistic, to say the least. It’s the ultimate beauty paradox: create the problem, then sell a temporary, expensive solution, knowing full well the 'final' solution is still a surgeon's scalpel away.

This isn’t just about vanity; it’s about the insidious creep of perfectionism, amplified by social media and filters. Every selfie, every video call, every accidental reflection is an opportunity to find fault. And now the neck, once a silent workhorse, is under review. It’s another symptom of a culture that demands constant improvement, even of the most benign body parts. Fair play to the brands for spotting a gap in the market, but at what cost to our collective sanity? We’re already a nation of anxious messes, do we really need another thing to add to the list?

So, the next time you're scrolling through your feed, maybe give your neck a break. It's doing a proper job holding your head up through all this madness. Perhaps we should all spend less time worrying about our 'problem areas' and more time appreciating the fact that our bodies, in all their imperfect glory, are actually quite brilliant. Or, you know, just buy the cream. Whatever helps you sleep at night, innit?
